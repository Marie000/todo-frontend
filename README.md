TODO:

- Improve UI / UX design
- Enable changing status from "done" or "in progress" to "pending" (currently only allows updates from "pending" -> "in progress" -> "done" -> "archived")
- Enable filter by status (e.g. hide "done", etc.)
- Fix: when modifying the due date, the current due date does not show in the input field
